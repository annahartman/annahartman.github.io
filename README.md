# Filtering Faces

In this project, I will focus on training neural networks to put filters, like those found on Snapchat or TikTok, on images/videos of faces. The neural network will identify key features and points on the face and apply the filters accordingly. This will be tested on novel faces that are positioned in different ways. While this already exists on the apps mentioned above, I’d like to try to reproduce that product using a new dataset and different filters. 

I would start this project on just static images, but I’d be interested to explore the complexity of applying filters to videos. My guess is this would be beyond our capabilities in this project, but I’m not sure yet. 

# Project goals:

1. Create or find a dataset of faces to train the network on
2. Train a neural network to recognize facial features
3. Look into expanding to video
